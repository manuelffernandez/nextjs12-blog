## Installation

For this project I used v18.14.2 of NodeJS. There is a _.nvmrc_ file to select the correct version with **nvm**.
To do this in Windows open a PowerShell terminal in the project directory and run `nvm use $(Get-Content .nvmrc)`.
In Linux or Mac, open a terminal in the project directory and run `nvm use`.

If you don't have nvm installed in your computer, ensure that you have that specific [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es) version installed in your computer.

#### <sub>See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for more info.</sub>

Once you have installed all the dependencies open a terminal in the projects root directory and execute `npm run dev`, after that dev server will run at port 3000.
